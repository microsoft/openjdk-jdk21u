- details:
  - New IR node (suggested by V. Kozlov), named SafePointScalarMergeNode, to represent a set of SafePointScalarObjectNode;
  - Each scalar replaceable input participating in a merge will get a SafePointScalarObjectNode like if it weren't part of a merge;
  - Add a new Class to support the rematerialization of SR objects that are part of a merge;
  - Patch HotSpot to be able to serialize and deserialize debug information related to allocation merges;
  - Patch C2 to generate unique types for SR objects participating in some allocation merges.
  - Fix for C2: Live Node limit exceeded limit after JDK-8316991
  - Fix for C2: assert((uint)type <= T_CONFLICT && _zero_type[type] != nullptr) failed: bad type with -XX:-UseCompressedClassPointers
  - Fix for C2: CTW fail with assert(adr_t->is_known_instance_field()) failed: instance
  - Fix for C2: NPE in ArrayCreationTree.java with -XX:-UseCompressedOops
- release_note: New feature to improve the performance of Escape Analysis by increasing the number of opportunities for Scalar Replacement.
