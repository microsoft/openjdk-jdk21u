- details:
  - From https://github.com/openjdk/jdk23u/pull/231.  We have caught this in some
  - prod environments, where prctl is forbidden by the sandboxing mechanism. This fails the JVM.
  - Does not apply cleanly, the backport depends on FloatRegister changes from JDK-8339063 which
  - are included in src/hotspot/cpu/aarch64/register_aarch64.hpp.
- release_note: Address issues when PRCTL is disabled.
